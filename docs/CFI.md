# The tracker and the Cannabis Freedom Index

The Cannabis Freedom Index (cannabisfreedom.fyi, checkout `../cannabis-freedom-index`) records what
each country's law allows and how it got there: its history of laws, rulings and treaties. The
tracker records how the law is applied: raids, seizures, eradication, arrests, prosecutions and
sentences. Country ids are the CFI's.

## What goes where

**Comes here (a report):** a single enforcement event since 2000 that changes no law: an operation,
a raid, a seizure, fields destroyed, an arrest, a trial, a sentence, or an appeal that only changes a
sentence.

**Goes to the CFI history** (its `changes.yaml`, see its `docs/DATA-MAINTENANCE.md`, "Enforcement events
go to the tracker"):

- anything that changes the law or a country's score, and court rulings that set a precedent;
- events before 2000;
- famous and landmark cases (a celebrity or politician, a case that started a reform, the first
  sentence under a new law);
- national statistics and the overall picture (yearly figures, a crackdown or an amnesty announced
  as policy);
- executions and death sentences (the CFI keeps each country's death-penalty record);
- anything a CFI atlas entry lists or a did-you-know fact names.

Found a change in the law while looking for reports? Add it to the CFI history (its
`expand-country` skill), not here.

## How the two are connected

- `npm run countries:sync` copies the CFI's places, scores and summaries for the CFI widget on
  country pages (README, "Country ids and the CFI widget").
- In the CFI, `node scripts/sync-tracker.mjs` copies a line per report into its `src/data/tracker.json`
  for the **Enforcement** section of each profile. Run it there after reports are committed here.
- `scripts/import-cfi-history.mjs` moved the CFI's existing enforcement entries here (416 in October
  2026), keeping each entry's id as the slug and in `cfi_id`; the CFI's `scripts/move-to-tracker.mjs`
  then took them out of its history and redirects their old `/history/<id>/` addresses here. Running
  the import again only adds entries that are not here yet.

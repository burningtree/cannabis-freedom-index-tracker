# Historical model attribution recovery

Audit date: 2026-10-30. The audit began with 561 reports whose creator was recorded as
`unknown`. Only explicit, report-specific historical attribution was used. Existing known
creators were left unchanged.

## Result

Recovered 22 creators: 12 from the report's creation commit co-author and 10 from the
original CFI article's `model` field. The imported articles' creation and pre-transfer
model fields agree. The remaining 539 reports stay `unknown`:

- 133 tracker-native reports have no named model in their creation commit or original front matter.
- 31 imported articles have no recorded model in their original article metadata or creation commit.
- 375 other imports have no article-level attribution; their original CFI entry creation commits
  also do not identify a model.

Imports were traced through `cfi_id` into the CFI repository before its transfer commit
`a1cb631a90af6868bf2d5434ffd2a85ce3de3844`. The tracker import commit's Claude co-author
was **not** treated as the creator of the imported material. A generic Cursor co-author,
a neighbouring report's model, an unrelated edit, or the current model configuration is
not evidence of the original creator.

The audit also checked historical `created_by_model` changes. A Mauritius report briefly
carried a Muse Spark attribution during an accidental replacement; [the restoration
commit](https://github.com/burningtree/cannabis-freedom-index-tracker/commit/a40af2d)
reinstated the original report. That discarded rewrite's model was not assigned to the
restored original.

Identifiers use vendor prefixes with the model labels preserved in history: `opus-5.5`,
`gpt-6` and `gpt-6.1-sol`. No API deployment alias or reasoning effort is inferred where
it was not recorded. In particular, the Claude co-author records the model name/version,
not a reasoning setting.

Only `created_by_model` changed in the reports. Their text, sources, dates, status and
other front matter were preserved. No update-model metadata was added.

# Cannabis Enforcement Tracker

An open-source, global record of cannabis **eradication, seizures, raids, arrests, prosecutions,
sentences, executions and deaths**. It documents what the prohibition of cannabis does in practice:
the human, economic and cultural cost that the text of a law does not show.

Every report is short, plain and sourced: each sentence cites a source that was opened and read,
Wikipedia-style (`[@1]`). The build refuses a report without sources.

It is a companion to the [Cannabis Freedom Index](https://cannabisfreedom.fyi/) (CFI), which scores
what each country's laws allow. Country ids are the CFI's, so every report links to the law behind
it, and the CFI can show the tracker's reports on its country profiles through the JSON API below.

Site: <https://tracker.cannabisfreedom.fyi> (static, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/)).

## Pages

| Address | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `/` | **Map**: a full-screen map of all reports (the view is kept in the address, `#map=zoom/lat/lon`, so it can be shared) (a diamond marker per type; grouping crowded markers into clusters is an option in the Layers panel) with a pane on the right: the newest reports; filter by type, country and free text, use synchronized time controls on the map and in the panel, or select a period in the timeline; filters are kept in the address (`/?type=sentence&country=ge&year=2025`) |
| `/reports/` | **Reports**: the same filterable list as a page of its own, with an RSS subscription button and automatic loading as you scroll |
| `/<year>/`, `/<year>/<month>/` | The archive by date: a year's months, and every report of a month (`/2026/08/`) |
| `/report/<slug>/` | One report: figures, text with citations, sources, map pin, link to the CFI profile, related reports; semantic article markup and Article metadata support native browser reader views; availability is decided by the browser |
| `/country/<id>/` | A country's or state's reports, totals and map (`/country/ng/`, `/country/us/ca/`) |
| `/country/` | All countries with reports |
| `/stats/` | Totals, reports per month since the first report, by type, region and year, top countries |
| `/changelog/` | Paginated commit history: reports added, edited, deleted and renamed, report descriptions, countries, categories and changed fields, plus a timeline of report changes; refreshed at build time |
| `/feed.xml` | RSS feed of the 50 newest reports |
| `/about/` | What a report is, the types and statuses |
| `/api/…` | JSON, see below |

The map is [MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/) on [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/)'s
dark and light (positron) vector styles (OpenStreetMap data, no API key), switched with the site's
dark/light theme (the button in the top bar; the reader's choice is remembered, otherwise the
system's is followed). The style URLs are `MAP_STYLES` in `src/lib/map.js`. Each type has a diamond marker with a pictogram (`typeIcon` in `src/lib/types.js`,
also used by the legend), in warm colours for what is done to land and people and cooler ones for
the courts; there is no green, which belongs to the Landrace layers.

On the Reports page, scrolling near the bottom automatically appends the next 30 reports.
Filters reset the loaded list; year/month navigation remains available. Browsers without
IntersectionObserver keep the **Show more** button. After building the site and installing the
browser, run `node scripts/check-report-scroll.mjs` for the scrolling regression checks.

The map's quick period buttons and the panel's **Time** selector share one time filter.
Choose Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last year or All time for a preset, or **Calendar dates…**
for a year, month or day. Calendar selections switch off rolling-window restrictions; choosing
a preset clears calendar selections. The map highlights **Calendar** while calendar dates are
active. The Reports page offers only All time and Calendar dates, without relative presets.
Shared links retain the same selection, and older links with both recent and calendar
parameters resolve to the calendar selection.

The Reports timeline includes a count scale, gridlines and zero-day baseline markers.
Use **Clear all filters** to reset search, category, country and time selections to All time.
Timeline bars show category-count tooltips on hover or keyboard focus. Selecting a year or month
drills into that period; selecting a day filters both the report list and map to that exact date.
Day filters are shareable as `?date=2026-10-26` and combine with the other filters. Use **Clear day**
or select the same day again to remove the day filter.
Browser tooltip regressions (rapid hover, keyboard access and scrolling) can be checked with
`node scripts/check-timeline-tooltip.mjs` after `npm run browser-install`.

### Landrace layers

The map's "Layers" switch shows [Landrace.wiki](https://landrace.wiki/)'s growing areas (their
outlines; on by default), growing regions (dashed outlines) and accessions: where landrace cannabis has been grown and collected for generations, next
to where it is destroyed. The data is a snapshot in `public/layers/`: `landrace.geojson` (points),
`landrace-areas.geojson` and `landrace-regions.geojson` (outlines from the wiki's `Module:Boundaries`
data pages, simplified in proportion to each shape), © Landrace.wiki contributors, **CC BY-SA 4.0**;
point coordinates are already offset by about 500 m by Landrace.wiki. Each file loads only when a
layer that needs it is on. Refresh it by hand with

```bash
node scripts/sync-landrace.mjs
```

(about 17 requests to their API, three seconds apart). Their API page asks to be emailed (privacy@landrace.wiki) before
any regular harvest, so don't put it on a schedule without that.

## Adding a report

1. Find the event in a reliable source and **open it**. Prefer the agency's own statement or court
   record, plus independent reporting. Use only facts the sources state.
2. Create `reports/<year>/<month>/<slug>.md` for the date of the event. The file name is the slug and
   the report's address: lower case, digits and hyphens, unique across all years
   (`ndlea-edo-igbanke-farms`).
3. Fill in the front matter and write the text (format below). Cite every sentence with `[@n]`, the
   number of the source in `sources`. Every source must be cited at least once.
4. Run `npm test` (a second) and `npm run build`.

The full guide is [docs/WRITING.md](docs/WRITING.md). For agents: to add a report from a URL, see
[.claude/skills/add-report/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/add-report/SKILL.md); to find new events,
[.claude/skills/find-reports/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/find-reports/SKILL.md).

Writing: lead with what happened to people (who was arrested, jailed, lost their crop or land),
then the figures, then context. Use the source's numbers, and say whose numbers they are ("the
agency valued them at …"). No law-number lists, no adjectives the source does not support.

```

The rules live in two places, both run by `npm run build`:

- `src/content.config.ts`, the zod schema: fields, types, the CFI country ids, at least one source,
  coordinates need a precision.
- `scripts/reports.test.mjs` (`npm test`): the file sits in the folder of its date, slugs are
  unique, every citation names a source and every source is cited.

Citations are turned into numbered links by a Markdown plugin in `astro.config.mjs` (the same one as
the CFI's); it also stops the build on a citation to a missing source.

### Country ids and the CFI widget

`src/data/countries.json` is a copy of the CFI's places: ids, names, regions, legal status, and what
the **Cannabis Freedom Index widget** on each country page shows (score, tier, rank, the six segment
scores, summary, review date, score history). Names and segment scores come from a CFI checkout; the
score and tier as the CFI publishes them (including national estimates and states) and the history
come from the live site. Refresh it with:

```bash
npm run countries:sync -- ../cannabis-freedom-index
```

(`--local` reads the checkout's built `dist/` instead of the live site.) In the browser the widget
then refreshes itself from the CFI's own `https://cannabisfreedom.fyi/api/<id>.json` (current score,
summary, score line since 1900, the latest law changes that moved the score, cannabis use). States
have no such file and keep the built-in copy. Report pages show a compact version under "The law
there".

## Build

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm test
```

```bash
npm run build
```

`npm run build` runs the tests first and writes the site to `dist/`. Set `SITE` and `BASE_PATH` to
build for another address. The changelog requires a Git checkout with full history (`git fetch --unshallow` for a shallow clone); partial history is labeled on the page. In development, the changelog checks Git HEAD once per second, clears cached history and refreshes an open changelog after a commit or branch switch. Restart an already-running dev server once after installing this change. `npm run dev` starts a local dev server.

## JSON API

All files are static and rebuilt with the site. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`, coordinates `[lat, lon]`.

### Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `/api/reports.json` | every report |
| `/api/reports/<year>.json` | one year's reports (`/api/reports/2026.json`) |
| `/api/latest.json` | the 100 newest, with `total` |
| `/api/country/<id>.json` | one country or state |

`/api/index.json` is the site's own compact index for the map and the filters; it may change
without notice.

### `/api/reports.json`

Every report, newest first.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "generated": "2026-10-29T00:00:00.000Z",
  "count": 8,
  "types": { "eradication": { "label": "Eradication", "color": "#5f9e57" }, "…": {} },
  "by_type": { "eradication": 5, "seizure": 1, "…": 0 },
  "reports": [ /* report objects, below */ ]
}
```

### `/api/country/<id>.json`

One file for **every** CFI place, with or without reports, so a CFI profile can always fetch its
own: `/api/country/ng.json`, `/api/country/us/ca.json`. A country's file includes its states'
reports (`us.json` lists `us/ca`'s).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "ng",
  "name": "Nigeria",
  "url": "https://tracker.cannabisfreedom.fyi/country/ng/",   // null if no reports
  "count": 1,
  "totals": { "reports": 1, "arrested": 11, "plants_destroyed": 0, "hectares": 1.85, "kg_seized": 0, "deaths": 0 },
  "by_type": { "eradication": 1, "…": 0 },
  "latest": "2026-08-17",                                       // null if no reports
  "reports": [ /* report objects */ ]
}
```

### Report object

```json
{
  "id": "ndlea-edo-igbanke-farms",
  "url": "https://tracker.cannabisfreedom.fyi/report/ndlea-edo-igbanke-farms/",
  "date": "2026-08-17",
  "country": "ng",
  "country_name": "Nigeria",
  "place": "Igbanke forest, Orhionmwon, Edo State",
  "coordinates": [6.38, 6.17],
  "precision": "district",
  "type": "eradication",
  "also": ["arrest"],
  "title": "NDLEA destroys two cannabis farms in Edo and makes eleven arrests",
  "summary": "…",
  "status": "verified",
  "figures": { "hectares": 1.85, "arrested": 11 },
  "tags": ["ndlea", "farmers", "legalisation-debate"],
  "sources": [{ "title": "…", "url": "…", "publisher": "Sahara Reporters", "date": "2026-08-17", "archived": null }]
}
```

`coordinates` falls back to the middle of the country (`precision: "country"`) when the report gives
none. `figures` holds only the keys a report states. Fields may be added in later versions; existing
fields keep their meaning while `version` is 1.

## Evidence archive

`node scripts/archive-media.mjs [slug …]` saves every picture on each report's source and media pages
to `archive/<slug>/` with a manifest (page, image URL, date fetched, SHA-256), so the evidence
survives if the pages change or disappear. `archive/` is ignored by git and not part of the site,
because most of the pictures belong to their publishers; back it up privately.

## Archived copies of sources

`node scripts/archive-sources.mjs` looks up each source and media page in the Wayback Machine and
writes the newest snapshot into the report as `archived:`. With `--save` it also asks the Wayback
Machine to save pages it has no copy of yet; with slugs it does only those reports; `--dry` writes
nothing.

## Built for thousands of reports

The tracker is organised by date: files in `reports/<year>/<month>/`, archive pages per year and
month, a timeline per month. Pages do not grow with the number of reports: the home page carries the
30 newest and loads one compact, cached index (`/api/index.json`, about 135 KB gzipped for 5,000
reports) for the map, the filters and "Show more"; the map clusters dots; report pages load the same
index for their map instead of embedding other reports; a country page shows its 20 newest in full
and the rest as one line each, by year.

```bash
node scripts/load-test.mjs 5000
```

builds the site from 5,000 synthetic reports in `.cache/load-test/` (not in `reports/`) and prints
the build time and the size of the main pages and files. With 5,000 reports: about 18 s, home page
37 KB, a report page 8 KB.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and publishes the site to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`
(the tests run first; a failure stops the deploy). To set it up once:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**.
3. Settings → Pages → Custom domain: `tracker.cannabisfreedom.fyi` (also in `public/CNAME`), and at
   the DNS host a `CNAME` record `tracker` → `<user>.github.io`. Turn on "Enforce HTTPS" once the
   certificate is issued.

The site address and base path come from the Pages settings, so the build also works on
`<user>.github.io/<repo>/` before the domain is set.

## Planned

- AI-assisted collection: drafts from news and agency feeds, saved with `status: reported`, then
  checked by a person against the opened sources before they become `verified`.
- Archived copies of every source.
- Enforcement news on the CFI's country profiles, from `/api/country/<id>.json`.

## Licence

Code: MIT. Report texts and data: CC BY 4.0. Pictures keep their own licences, stated with each.

## Public submissions and Nostr service

The optional Go service in `backend/` adds anonymous source intake, durable receipts, Nostr mentions
and replies, sandboxed OpenCode research, live model/session activity, and automatic local report commits after validation. Astro and the public
report JSON API remain static. Pages: `/submission/?id=…` for request details, and `/submissions/` for the source form and
live request table. `/submit/` redirects to `/submissions/`. AI-created reports record `created_by_model` as `provider/model#effort` when available, shown on the report detail page. For example, `alibaba-token-plan/qwen3.8-flash#xhigh` records `xhigh` as the reasoning effort setting. Include the actual effort whenever known; omit only the suffix if effort is unavailable, and never guess it.
Later update models are kept in `updated_by_models` using the same format. Open questions are saved in report front matter
and shown beneath its sources. Local failed submissions have a restart control; no GitHub App is needed.

See [docs/NOSTR-SUBMISSIONS.md](docs/NOSTR-SUBMISSIONS.md) for setup, HTTP contracts, deployment,
privacy, backups, research isolation and rollout requirements. Use `backend/config.example.env`
for private service configuration and `.env.example` for public-only Astro build settings.
For JavaScript-rendered sources and archived screenshots/SEO metadata, install Chromium once with
`npm run browser-install` (`SOURCE_BROWSER=true` by default).
Local `backend-dev` loads the ignored root `.env`; it uses OpenCode’s saved credentials and the `RESEARCH_MODEL` set in `.env` or the process environment (`provider/model#effort` when the effort setting is known). There is no built-in model default. Do not prefix secrets with `PUBLIC_`. The form
stays unavailable in production until `PUBLIC_SUBMISSIONS_API_URL` is set. For local work, run
`npm run backend-dev` and `npm run dev` in separate terminals; the frontend connects to localhost automatically. Never include service secrets in an
Astro build. Backend checks: `cd backend && go test -race ./... && go vet ./...`.

The submission source vocabulary is synced from CFI's public `/api/glossary.json` with
`node scripts/sync-glossary.mjs [../cannabis-freedom-index|https://cannabisfreedom.fyi/]`.
The generated snapshot is embedded in the backend; rebuild/restart after syncing.

CFI glossary and language-atlas explanations also appear throughout tracker prose with dashed underlines and
hover/focus/tap tooltips. `node scripts/sync-glossary.mjs` updates both the backend recognition
vocabulary and `src/data/glossary.json`. Markdown gets term markup during builds; the shared
layout also marks summaries and live previews. Links, headings, form controls, citations, code,
maps and raw AI transcripts are left untouched. Atlas terms such as bhang also link to their
CFI article. Each glossary term is marked once per page.

// A report's short code: six characters of Crockford's base32 (digits and capitals without I, L, O
// and U), shown as CET-7KQ2MX, from a hash of its slug. scripts/codes.mjs writes it into the report
// once, so it stays the same if the slug later changes; until then the build works it out the same way.
